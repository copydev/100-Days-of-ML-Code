# 100 Days of Machine Learning - frextrite's Log

A little bit of background: I have been involved in Machine Learning since the past year or so. I've taken university courses and online courses(Andrew NG's, Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning and currently taking up Andrew NG's course on CNN) in this brief period of time. However, I've been into ML on and off(well, mostly off), and just have basic knowledge of scikit-learn and tensorflow. With this 100 Days of ML Code challenge I would like to strengthen my code writing skills that is get an insight into sci-kit learn library, tensorflow and also keras.

## Day 0: July 6, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Initialised the repository to keep track of my 100 Days of ML journey

**Thoughts** : Hope I can continue through the 100 days and do not stop in between :)

## Day 1: July 7, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created a simple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn library, baby-steps! Also, scraped Kaggle for ML datasets.

**Thoughts** : Maybe implement my own version of Linear Regression model in the future

## Day 2: July 8, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created a single layered Neural Network MNIST classifier using tensorflow. That's a combined dive into the world of tensorflow and neural networks!

**Thoughts** : The official tensorflow tutorial, MNIST for ML Beginners is really good as everything is explained in deep. I'm thinking of implementing a Deep Neural Network MNIST classifier and a CNN MNIST classifier and compare their accuracy.

## Day 3: July 9, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Created a Deep Neural Network MNIST Classifier. Learned a few things about tensorflow and Neural Networks in general while constructing this model, details inside the work folder.

**Thoughts** : Increasing the depth of a Neural Network and increasing the number of epochs increases the accuracy of the model but this tends to saturate at a particular limit. Further increase in both doesn't result in greater accuracies.

## Day 4: July 10, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Studied about various optimization techniques, including Gradient Descent and Adam Optimizer.

**Thoughts** : Implement my own various of these optimizing techniques maybe.
