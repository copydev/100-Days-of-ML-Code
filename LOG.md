# 100 Days of Machine Learning - frextrite's Log

A little bit of background: I have been involved in Machine Learning since the past year or so. I've taken university courses and online courses(Andrew NG's, Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning and currently taking up Andrew NG's course on CNN) in this brief period of time. However, I've been into ML on and off(well, mostly off), and just have basic knowledge of scikit-learn and tensorflow. With this 100 Days of ML Code challenge I would like to strengthen my code writing skills that is get an insight into sci-kit learn library, tensorflow and also keras.

## Day 0: July 6, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Initialised the repository to keep track of my 100 Days of ML journey

**Thoughts** : Hope I can continue through the 100 days and do not stop in between :)
