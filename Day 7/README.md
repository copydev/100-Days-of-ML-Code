MNIST classifier using CNN, having 2 convolution and 2 max-pool layers with ReLU activation. Further contains 2 hidden fully-connected layers with 1024 and 512 nodes each. This model also uses dropout to prevent over-fitting.

Update: Reran the model and I'm now getting an accuracy of 99.28%, which is its saturation limit.
